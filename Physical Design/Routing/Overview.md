Routing turns placed cells into legal wires/vias that meet DRC/DFM, timing, and SI (crosstalk) targets. It runs in stages: global routing plans coarse paths and budgets congestion; track assignment maps guides to exact tracks; detailed routing lays metal/vias honoring preferred directions, min-area/EOL/spacing, color/EUV rules, and via constraints. Post-route, we extract RC, run STA with coupling, fix setup/hold, antenna, shorts/opens, add redundant vias, and perform timing-aware metal fill before final sign-off (DRC/LVS/EM/SI).
