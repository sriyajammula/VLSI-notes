GDSII/OASIS generation converts the routed, sign-off-clean layout database into a foundry-ready mask file. You (1) freeze the design, (2) merge any hard IP GDS/OASIS, (3) apply the layer map to translate EDA layersâ†’foundry layer/datatype, (4) include dummy fill, slotting, seal ring, alignment marks, (5) strip non-manufacturing layers/text, (6) write GDSII or OASIS with correct units/on-grid, then (7) re-run DRC/LVS on the streamed file. Deliver the tapeout package (layout, golden netlist/SPEF, layer map, runset versions, waiver log, README). Most foundries now prefer OASIS (smaller, faster); GDSII is still widely accepted.
