Placement arranges standard cells on legal rows to minimize wirelength and meet timing, congestion, and power goals before CTS. It happens in stages: global placement (continuous optimization), legalization (snap to sites, fix overlaps), and detailed placement (local swaps/compaction). Modern placement is timing-driven & congestion-aware: it weights critical nets, spreads cells in hot bins, does buffering/sizing/cloning, and honors regions/fences, multi-V domains, and DRC/DFM guidance. The outputs are a legalized, timing-clean (pre-CTS) placement, decent HPWL, low congestion overflow, and reports that predict routability and IR/EM risk.
