What you should know about EM and IR ? 

1. Electromigration (EM)
 • Definition: Gradual movement of metal atoms in an interconnect due to momentum transfer from high-density electron flow.
 • Cause: High current density → electrons collide with metal atoms → displace them → create voids (opens) or hillocks (shorts).
 • Impact: Long-term reliability issue; can cause functional failure of ICs.

Factors affecting EM: 
 • Current density (J)
 • Temperature
 • Material properties (e.g., copper more resistant than aluminum)
 • Interconnect geometry

EM Mitigation Techniques:
 • Widen interconnects for high-current paths
 • Use redundant vias
 • Lower operating current density
 • Use EM-aware routing tools

2. IR Drop
 • Definition: Voltage drop across power distribution network (PDN) due to finite resistance of metal lines and vias.
 • Cause: V= I x R → when current flows through resistive PDN, supply voltage at transistors is reduced.
 • Impact: Lower VDD at load → slower switching → possible timing failures or logic errors.

Types of IR drops: 

 • Static IR Drop: Caused by steady DC currents (leakage + constant load).
 • Dynamic IR Drop: Caused by transient switching currents (simultaneous switching).

IR drop Mitigation Techniques:

 • Use wider/thicker power rails
 • Add more vias between layers
 • Place decoupling capacitors near loads
 • Optimize PDN layout for uniform distribution

⸻

In summary: 

 • Electromigration is a long-term degradation problem due to high current density.
 • IR drop is an immediate voltage loss problem due to resistive PDN.
