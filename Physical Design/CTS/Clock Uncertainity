Clock Uncertainty

1. What is Clock Uncertainty?

Clock uncertainty represents the inaccuracy or variability in the arrival of clock edges during real silicon operation compared to the ideal clock assumption in STA.

In STA, we assume a perfect clock, but in reality, factors like jitter, skew, and modeling limitations introduce uncertainty.
So, a margin (called clock uncertainty) is applied to make timing analysis more realistic and conservative.

2. Sources of Clock Uncertainty
 1. Clock Jitter
 • Random variation in the clock edge position due to PLL/oscillator noise.
 • Example: If PLL has ±50 ps jitter, STA must account for it.
 2. Clock Skew
 • Difference in clock arrival times at different flip-flops due to routing or buffer insertion.
 • Example: Clock at FF1 arrives earlier than at FF2 by 30 ps.
 3. Modeling/Tool Margins
 • STA tools add margins to cover unmodeled effects or process variations.

3. How Clock Uncertainty is Applied in STA

Clock uncertainty is specified using constraints (e.g., set_clock_uncertainty in Synopsys PrimeTime).
It reduces the available time for data to propagate, making the design more robust.

Setup check: 

Required Time = Clock Period – (Clock Uncertainty + Setup Time)

→ Uncertainty reduces available setup window.

Hold Check:

Required Hold Time = Hold Requirement + Clock Uncertainty

→ Uncertainty increases the hold requirement.

Thus, uncertainty is subtracted for setup checks and added for hold checks.

4. Example
 • Clock period = 1 ns
 • Jitter = 50 ps
 • Skew = 30 ps
 • Clock uncertainty = 80 ps
 • Setup slack calculation:

Effective Period = 1 ns – 80 ps = 920 ps

The data must meet setup within 920 ps instead of full 1 ns.

Hold slack calculation:

Effective Hold Requirement = Hold Time + 80 ps

Data must be stable longer to ensure reliability.

5. Why is Clock Uncertainty Important?
 • Captures non-ideal behavior of clocks in silicon.
 • Ensures timing sign-off margin against process, voltage, temperature (PVT) variations.
 • Prevents hidden setup/hold violations due to jitter/skew.
 • Critical in high-speed SoCs with small timing margins (e.g., <1 ns period).

Remember :
Clock uncertainty in STA is the safety margin applied to clock timing to account for jitter, skew, and modeling inaccuracy. It reduces setup slack and tightens hold checks, ensuring the design meets timing in real-world conditions.
