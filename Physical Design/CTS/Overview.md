CTS builds and sizes a buffered network from each clock source to all clock sinks (flops/latches/macro pins) to meet skew, latency (insertion delay), slew, power, and EM targets across MMMC corners. Modern CTS is timing-driven, congestion-aware, SI-aware, and honors ICG (integrated clock-gating) cells, domains, and DFT clocks. After CTS we propagate clocks, re-run STA with OCV/CPPR, then fix hold (mostly) and do clock routing with NDR/shielding.
