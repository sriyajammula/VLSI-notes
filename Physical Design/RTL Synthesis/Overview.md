RTL synthesis transforms Verilog/SystemVerilog into a gate-level netlist using the target standard-cell libraries (.lib/.db) under a set of constraints (SDC). The tool parses and elaborates RTL, builds a Boolean/timed graph, then maps and optimizes for timing, area, and power across MMMC scenarios. Modern flows are physical-aware (use tech RC and a tentative floorplan), do clock gating, retiming, multi-bit flop mapping, and emit a netlist, SDC, SDF, and QoR reports that feed place-and-route. Bad or missing constraints are the #1 reason results donâ€™t close later.
