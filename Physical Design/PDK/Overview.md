A PDK (Process Design Kit) is the foundry-supplied bundle that translates a manufacturing process into files and rules EDA tools can use. It defines layers, design rules, device models, parasitics, reliability limits, and tech data so we can synthesize, place/route, extract, time, and verify a chip. Practically, it includes tech LEF/DEF, DRC/LVS rule decks, SPICE models, timing/power libraries (.lib/.db), RC tech (.itf/.tlu+), antenna/density/DFM rules, EM/IR limits, ESD/IO rules, and documentation. Physical design uses these to build power grids, floorplan, set tracks/vias, close timing across MMMC corners, meet DRC/LVS/DFM, and sign off.
