Floorplanning defines the die/core size, aspect ratio, macro/IO placement, power grid, and placement regions so that routing, timing, power, and IR/EM targets are achievable. Steps: estimate area/utilization → choose aspect ratio → place large macros (SRAM/analog) with halos and channels → plan IO/pins and feedthroughs → define power rings/straps and tap/decap strategy → create blockages/regions/fences → trial-route and iterate on congestion/timing/IR. Good floorplans minimize long flylines, avoid notches, respect domain boundaries (UPF), and leave ECO headroom.
